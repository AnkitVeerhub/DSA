ðŸ”¥ Problem 2: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
Difficulty: Easy
Topic: Arrays, Sliding Window

Question:
You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the i-th day.
You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.
Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction.
If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

Example:
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]  
Output: 5  
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
